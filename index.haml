              We have experience with a large variety of business models that complement 
              our partners' assets, competencies and investments. Together with our partners, 
              we select the most appropriate commercial and technical set-up for each project.

            %p
              Our solution portfolio ranges from brand licensing/branded reselling to national 
              roaming - and includes any model 
              %span.nowrap in-between. 
              In the first case, we operationally 
              manage the whole mobile service delivery and rely on our partners' branding and 
              marketing assets. In the latter case, our partners run their own mobile (core) network.
